# PLUTO

PLUTO is a computational code for solving multi-dimensional Ideal and Resistive Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, specifically designed for solar physics applications. This code is particularly useful for studying phenomena such as the Solar Dynamo, differential rotation, meridional flow, and the Tachocline.

## Features
